# Mess-Managment-System
During my last semester in the Database and Management Systems course, I took on a project that I believe is truly innovative. I wasn't satisfied with the outdated mess management system at GIK, where the old pen-and-paper method is still in use. In an age where technology is at our fingertips, it seemed inefficient and inconvenient for both students and staff.
This inspired me to design a new system that better serves everyone involved. The idea was simple yet effective. Under this new system, each student logs in with their ID and purchases credits, which they can then use at the mess.

One of the key issues I addressed was the In/Out system. Currently, once you’re signed in for a meal, you're charged whether you eat or not, and you have to physically visit the mess to sign out. My solution allows students to manage their meal status online. With just a click, they can check in, and a credit is automatically deducted. The next day, they can decide whether to check in or not, providing flexibility and control over their meals.

Another challenge was managing students with outstanding bills. In my system, once a student’s credits are depleted, they cannot check in until more credits are purchased. This ensures that only those with available credits can access meals, streamlining the process for staff and ensuring accountability.
